# Float
Specification: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float)
#### The definition
    The float CSS property specifies that an element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container, where text and inline elements will wrap around it.

#### Note
The float property changed the behaviour of the rendering flow, the float elements will occupy the their space first, and leave the rest for other elements.

#### Questions?
- "Taken from the overflow" , what does this mean ?
- Since it could be applied for all kind of elements, how about the inline element with float property ?
- How will the float element affect its box model and others' box model ?
- With the code, explain the result of .content and .inside-header.
